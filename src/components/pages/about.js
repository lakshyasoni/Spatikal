            Spatikal is an online platform where we aim to provide vast information  and insights on various topics. Our primary focus is on removing the digital garbage and bringing out a wider essence to the topic to which the audience can completely rely on. Spatikal is derived from a Sanskrit word 'SPHATIKA’ which means ‘crystal’. A  crystal is a representation of transparency and uniqueness which is what we aim on inculcating in our business model. We want to project transparency in the information & content we provide and uniqueness in the way we present it.
